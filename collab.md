  <p>Document your contributions to the team presentation and explain your approach to collaborative
  scholarship. This portfolio item should contain the following:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Project Description (100 words) introducing us to the work undertaken: the digital humanities project/
    platform/tool you engaged with, what you produced using that project, and your research findings.</li>
    <li>Collaboration Statement (250 words) that explains how you approach collaborative scholarship, with
    examples of work done for the team project as evidence of the approach you describe. How does
    collaboration enrich your academic thinking? Are there any digital materials, approaches, or workflows
    you use when working in a team? How do you situate collaborative research within the digital
    humanitiesâ€”how does collaboration, as you approach it, advance your stated research agenda?</li>
    <li>At least 3 images of your team presentation work, providing evidence of the work outlined in your two
    statements (these can be your presentation slides or something else, as long as it demonstrates the
    work you did). These images can appear at any point in the page (they need not all appear at the
    bottom).</li>
