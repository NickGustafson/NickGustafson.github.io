  <p><strong>Project Description</strong><br />
  Used MapJS to create a sequential geographic represenation of the events described in the young adult novel "Underground to Canada" by Barbara Smucker.  This is also a digitization of a similar project created 27 years earlier by myself.

  <p><strong>Collaboration Statement</strong> 
  In theory, my conception of collaborative work would involve equal contributions by all participants.  Each group member would bring forward an idea and the group would select the best one (or a synthesis of the best ones) to proceed with.  The requirements would be analyzed and the work would be fairly distributed based upon a combination of ability, interest and availability.  As work proceeded, the team would regularly communication by email and meet in person as necessary (at least once before the project deadline).  By the end of the project, each would have gained an equal understanding of the subject.
In reality, I came up with the idea to focus on StoryMapJS and to use one of my old projects as the content of the demonstration.  No one had any other suggestions.
