<p><strong>Research statement</strong><br />
I will soon be completed my second year of the Interactive Arts and Science at Brock University.  I do not really have a specific interest or area of specialization within the digital humanities.  None of my existing projects are relective of the emphasis I do not have.  I have not demonstrated expertise in any specialization.  I don not know where I will take this work in the future. 
</p>

<!--						
A 200 word statement that answers the following questions:

- What is your major and year?
- What is your specific research interest/area of specialization within the digital humanities? What
research program would you like to undertake in the field?
- How are your existing projects reflective of this emphasis? How have you already demonstrated
expertise in your stated specialization?
- Where will you take this work in the future? (Assume you will continue to do research within the digital
humanities, even if this is not the case)						

Here is a short list of areas of specialization: critical infrastructure studies, geospatial analysis, data
visualization, text analysis, algorithmic criticism, media archaeology, cultural studies, built media
scholarship, and open access publishing. You are by no means restricted to this list when choosing a
specialization.

<h3>&quot;Is Programmatic Thinking Racist?&quot;</h3>

<strong>Abstract</strong><br />
This post examined the arguments made by McPherson in "Why Are the Digital Humanities So White? or Thinking the Histories of Race and Computation", specifically her contention that racist patterns of thought embedded in the tools of the digital humanist had ultimately influenced considerations of race in the field.<br /><br />

In my response, I focused upon McPherson's contention that UNIX, as a predecessor to the modern O/S, had been encoded with "modes of racism" because of the era in which it was created.  I challenged the idea that casual users would neither know nor care how code was constructed and that there was as much evidence of a gender or linguistic bias on the part of the developers, which she did not mention.  I pointed out that correlation does not imply causation, or at least, not necessarily the directionality she suggested, and even if it did, that people and programs were not equivalent.  Finally, I dismissed the idea that programmers could not approach digital and real world problems in different manners.<br /><br />

Regardless of whether her conclusion is correct, or indeed if that is even the point, the questions that McPherson raised and that my post attempted to address are significant to the study of digital humanities.  As in any experiment,  it is important to understand and account for any pre-existing conditions that may have an undesired effect upon the outcome.  If any element has skewed the result, that element must be corrected or must be adjusted for.

<strong>Research process</strong><br />
I would not say that much evolution occurred over time in this research.  Obviously, I fully read McPherson's article for a second time in preparation for writing my blog post, and I made a less thorough re-examination of the other course readings to determine which was most applicable to reference, deciding upon Drucker.  The bibliography section of both articles was a great starting point for locating further works on the same topic, which took me to the University's online library resources, leading to the second McPherson and Svensson articles.  I found the Princeton article on the history of UNIX through Google, and I thought would be interesting to perform text analysis upon.<br /><br />

The added approximately 300 words to the end of my blog post, per the feedback I received from the instructor.  First, a brief discussion of whether McPherson's approach to the article was alienating to her audience, which I suggested it was and possibly intentionally so.  Next, I added a comment about my intention for the included Voyant visualizations.  In retrospect, I probably should not have left these to speak for themselves in the original submission.  Finally, I talked about my understanding of the term &quot;modularity&quot; and included a example from a recent web development project for a different course.<br /><br />

I would say that this work has increased my knowledge of the visualization tools available online.  My previous exposure was mainly related to web analytics, which parsed log files and generated very different outputs.
