    <strong>Research statement</strong>
      A 200 word statement that answers the following questions:
      <ul>
        <li>What is your major and year?</li>
        <li>What is your specific research interest/area of specialization within the digital humanities? What
        research program would you like to undertake in the field?</li>
        <li>How are your existing projects reflective of this emphasis? How have you already demonstrated
        expertise in your stated specialization?</li>
        <li>Where will you take this work in the future? (Assume you will continue to do research within the digital
        humanities, even if this is not the case)</li>
      </ul>
      
      Here is a short list of areas of specialization: critical infrastructure studies, geospatial analysis, data
      visualization, text analysis, algorithmic criticism, media archaeology, cultural studies, built media
      scholarship, and open access publishing. You are by no means restricted to this list when choosing a
      specialization.
