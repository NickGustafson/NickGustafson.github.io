<p><strong>Research statement</strong><br />
I will soon be completed my second year of the Interactive Arts and Science at Brock University.  I do not really have a specific interest or area of specialization within the digital humanities.  None of my existing projects are relective of the emphasis I do not have.  I have not demonstrated expertise in any specialization.  I don not know where I will take this work in the future. 
</p>

<!--						
A 200 word statement that answers the following questions:

- What is your major and year?
- What is your specific research interest/area of specialization within the digital humanities? What
research program would you like to undertake in the field?
- How are your existing projects reflective of this emphasis? How have you already demonstrated
expertise in your stated specialization?
- Where will you take this work in the future? (Assume you will continue to do research within the digital
humanities, even if this is not the case)						

Here is a short list of areas of specialization: critical infrastructure studies, geospatial analysis, data
visualization, text analysis, algorithmic criticism, media archaeology, cultural studies, built media
scholarship, and open access publishing. You are by no means restricted to this list when choosing a
specialization.

<strong>Abstract</strong><br />
This academic blog post examined the arguments made by Tara McPherson in her 2012 article "Why Are the Digital Humanities So White? or Thinking the Histories of Race and Computation", specifically her contention that racist patterns of thought embedded in the tools of the digital humanist had ultimately influenced considerations of race in the field.
